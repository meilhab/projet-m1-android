Good afternoon ladies and gentleman, 
My name is benoit and with guillaume, we are going to talk today about our supervised project which is about Android.
Since several years, mobile phone market knows a huge revolution with smartphones. 
A smartphone is a mobile phone that offers more advanced computing ability and connectivity than a normal phone.
The revolution was launched by Apple with its IPhone. After that, Google realized the potential of this market and decided to get inside. Android was created.
The subject of our project is to study the Android platform and develop an application with it.
We have divided our talk into 4 parts :

After that, we will make you a presentation of android.
The third part will focus on the specification of the application that we have to develop.
