Good afternoon, everybody,
My name is Benoit and with Guillaume, we are going to talk today about the wireless network security.
As you know, wireless network has grown more and more since several years, and it's very important now, with smartphones.
No more wire, it's a big advantage but if you can't secure this network, you can become vulnerable to other people.
We have divided our talk into three points.
To start with we will make a short presentation about wireless network.
After that, why it can be dangerous to have a not protected wireless network. 
And finally, the solutions we can bring to protect the network.

Let's start with a presentation of wireless network.
Wireless network refer to any type of computer network that is not connected by cable of any kind.
This method use radio waves to do this.
It exists four types of wireless connections :
    ->Wireless Personal Area Networks : it's used in a small area for example bluetooth or infrared light;
    ->Wireless Local Area Networks : it cover several meters for example WiFi;
    ->Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks : it cover several kilometers for example WiMAX;
    ->Wireless Wide Area Networks : it cover large outdoor areas for example GPRS, GSM for smartphones.
So much for the presentation.

Let's look now at how it can be dangerous to use network without protection. There is many people, like me, who will be happy to find a network without any security.
Now, I will defer to Guillaume to continue.
